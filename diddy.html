    <h3>Welcome to Diddy’s World</h3>
    <p>This is the page dedicated to Diddy, one of the freakiest characters out there.</p>

        P. Diddy’s transformation into “freaky” territory didn’t happen overnight—it’s a wild blend of eccentric moves, legendary parties, and a sprinkle of scandal that somehow only made him more of a mysterious icon to Gen Z.
        
        It all started with his infamous “White Party” era, where Diddy threw extravagant, all-white dress code bashes that were more like cultural events than parties. But things took a freaky turn when rumors spread that at one of these parties, there was a secret room where the dress code was "leave your dignity at the door." Some say that what went down in that room can’t even be explained without a tinfoil hat and a degree in conspiracy theories. Diddy never confirmed or denied it—instead, he just laughed it off with one of his classic “Take that, take that” catchphrases, which somehow made the mystery even freakier.
        
        Then came the “10-minute controversy” when Diddy suddenly started charging people $500 for a 10-minute Zoom call with him during the pandemic, promising “life-changing advice.” Some people claimed they got wisdom straight from a motivational guru, while others said he just stared into the camera, nodding like he was dropping the deepest truths without saying a word. Either way, Gen Z saw it as peak chaotic energy and turned him into a meme factory overnight.</p>
